### Effective Programming Techniques Projects Repository

Welcome to the Effective Programming Techniques Projects Repository! This repository contains projects completed during the third semester for the Effective Programming Techniques course. The course aimed to teach memory management in C++.

#### Project Overview
The projects focused on various aspects of C++ programming, emphasizing effective memory management techniques.

1. TEP1 - project primarily deals with arrays and their effective utilization.

2. TEP2 - includes custom implementations for storing numbers and deals with operator overloading.

3. TEP3 - involves the implementation of a binary tree data structure for processing mathematical formulas.

4. TEP4 - builds upon the concepts introduced in TEP3 and explores the use of templates for generic programming, serving as a continuation of TEP3.
